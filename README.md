This folder was created based off requests from the Squamish Nation for an access map which would visualize barriers to culturally important plant species within the territory. 
In this folder there is the Indigenous_plants_map.html which is the main map and can be hosted on any server. Within the Indigenous_plants_map, there are multiple buttons that activate the community_entry_form.html as well as the layers found in the EXT folder. 
In order for responses to save properly, both the Indigenous_plants_map.html and the community_entry_form.html must be hosted on the same server and some of the script in app.py and community_entry_form.html may have to be altered. 
The Survey_data folder houses all scripts related to the community_entry_form so that responses are automatically saved in the responses.geosjon file. The responses.geojson file can then be dislayed as a layer in the Indigenous_plants_map if correctly called from the html. 
The Alpine_Fieldwork_Ethnobotany_Season_Summary1.docx and SN_Culturally_Significant_Vegetation-ERoss-1.pdf contain additional information about culturally important plant species for the Squamish Nation. 
Any questions about this project can be directed to elizabethmccleary11@gmail.com or nboulangerlapointe@uvic.ca 
We would love to collaborate further to tailor this map to continually fit the needs of the Squamish Nation. 
We transfer complete ownership to the Nation in persuit of data sovereignty and cultural safety.
